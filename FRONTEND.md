# Verba - Frontend Documentation

Verba's Frontend is a [NextJS](https://nextjs.org/) application using [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) with [shadcn/ui](https://ui.shadcn.com/) (Radix + Tailwind) components.

## Data Fetching & Caching (TanStack Query)

- Wrapped the app in `QueryClientProvider` (`app/providers.tsx`), included Devtools.
- Common queries live in `app/lib/queries.ts` (documents, labels, RAG config, datacount, delete mutation).
- Example usage: `DocumentSearch` now uses `useDocumentsQuery` to fetch and paginate without `useEffect`.

## UI Migration Notes

- New primitives in `app/components/ui` mirror shadcn/ui (button, dialog, dropdown, input, textarea, checkbox, select, badge, card, spinner, etc.).
- DaisyUI has been removed. All dialogs, dropdowns, inputs, checkboxes, toggles, spinners, and separators now use shadcn/ui.
- For complex layouts/interactions, we take inspiration from Kibo UI, Origin UI, and Blocks, while keeping shadcn primitives for consistency.

## ðŸš€ Setting Up the Frontend

To get your local copy of the Verba frontend up and running, please follow these simple steps:

1. Clone Repository

```git

git clone https://github.com/weaviate/Verba.git

```

1. **Node.js Requirement**:

   - Confirm that Node.js version `>=21.3.0` is installed on your system. If you need to install or update Node.js, visit the official [Node.js website](https://nodejs.org/).

2. **Installation**:

   - Navigate to the frontend directory: `cd frontend`
   - Run `npm install` to install the dependencies required for the project.

3. **Development Server**:
   - Launch the application in development mode by executing `npm run dev`.
   - Open your web browser and visit `http://localhost:3000` to view the application.

## ðŸ“¦ Building Static Pages for FastAPI

If you wish to serve and update the frontend through FastAPI, you need to build static pages:

1. **Build Process**:
   - Execute `npm run build` to generate the static production build. The output will be directed to the FastAPI folder configured to serve the static content.
